#+title: qtMUD
#+description: Software for running traditionally text-interface services, typically role-playing games.
qtMUD is a piece of software for running (traditionally) text-interface services, which are typically role-playing games.

What follows is the software's source code, including tests and demonstrations. Please note this project is in early development.

Code is divided into the following sections:
